## Testing

We use Jest for testing. Please ensure:

- All new code has corresponding tests
- Test coverage remains above 90%
- Tests are descriptive and test both success and error cases

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test           # Run all tests
npm run test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
npm run coverage   # Generate coverage report
```

## Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

- Follow the existing code style
- Run `npm run lint` to check your code
- Configure your editor to use Prettier for auto-formatting

### Code Guidelines

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear, concise comments
